### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* Add ability for matchers to validate their own content. This is a breaking change for any plugin authors, as matcher Executor implementations now need to provide validation functions

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* Replace the config object in triggers with a clearer SetupInfo type, allowing cross-language function calls as mocks. Note that the function calls now always return json strings, user-facing DSLs will need to parse the strings
