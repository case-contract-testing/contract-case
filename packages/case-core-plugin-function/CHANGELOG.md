### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **core:** Removed the assumption that every interaction response can be described by "returns". This is a breaking change, because it needs contracts to be re-written, and http contracts with automatically named triggers will have to change triggers from \`"a (200) ..."\` to \`"returns a (200) ..."\`. If you need to stay compatible with contracts from before this version, you will need to provide both names in your trigger definitions

* **function-plugin:** Substantially improved error messages when functions throw instead of returning, or receive the wrong number of arguments ([d25d819](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/d25d819a8478b887e7fc1bb4a747d0c0bd4428dc))
