# Changelog

## [0.24.2](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/compare/@contract-case/case-core-v0.24.1...@contract-case/case-core-v0.24.2) (2025-06-11)


### Features

* Add ability to override some configuration advice via adviceOverrides ([ef171e2](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/ef171e27225a6db1fd32e9c99c6d8b1ed3bd1a17))


### Bug Fixes

* **cli:** Downloaded contracts no longer write a main contract file, as we can't tell which one is main ([9631a77](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/9631a77ec58a2f35d7f0825c27822260cf1987bd))
* **core:** Ignore non-json files in the contract dir ([ae5f8a8](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/ae5f8a807323a38ff016f1dc68f96f50835a4a57))
* **core:** Improve debug logs when the required state handlers are missing ([a0d3292](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/a0d32928c269c51e05f4f7633537b22f5a5f7498))
* **core:** Now the verifier no longer says it's publishing results when it's only finalising the rverification ([e8b275f](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/e8b275f20ae80e702de08bf4ce4f0c061bb4a94b))
* **core:** The verifier no longer warns that it's not publishing contracts when you've explicitly told it not to ([673ebba](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/673ebba76237b70092c5f4646d552df3f13a37a8))

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **core:** Updated the behaviour of `contractFilename` to be controlled by `changedContracts`, to match `contractDir`. This is a breaking change, as previously it assumed that overwriting contracts was forbidden with an explicit filename
* **core:** Now writing a new contract for the first time requires changedContracts=OVERWRITE

### Features

* **core:** Now writing a new contract for the first time requires changedContracts=OVERWRITE ([fee2b4f](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/fee2b4f568ba2f23997a9edea61c1090b733d129))


### Bug Fixes

* **core:** Improve the logging of location context ([500cbb7](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/500cbb7a1d3f14ee810bde2f3e3b2627acb29e96))
* **core:** Trying to define an empty contract now throws a CaseConfigurationError ([0f1d8a6](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/0f1d8a625cc8b4b452b58e9cfeda997ffb35c514))

* Improve logging of contract equality check ([1999430](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/19994302cc57bdd26094c5c6d4f53fa7e50b2edd))

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **core:** New behaviour of using contacts like snapshots - the new setting changedContracts changes the behaviour when contracts are changed. Either 'FAIL' for fail when a contract is changed, or 'OVERWRITE' for overwriting when a contract is changed. Default is to FAIL, so this is a breaking change.

### Features

* **cli:** Add ability to invoke can-i-deploy from the CLI ([b2351ca](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/b2351cabd548d6b62b631fd45966cc2263325276))
* **core:** Add ability to ask broker if it is safe to deploy ([17a3ec5](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/17a3ec5ecb7d5676137a4f7cd84dc4bb3e68d67b))
* **core:** New behaviour of using contacts like snapshots - the new setting changedContracts changes the behaviour when contracts are changed. Either 'FAIL' for fail when a contract is changed, or 'OVERWRITE' for overwriting when a contract is changed. Default is to FAIL, so this is a breaking change. ([b8dcd1f](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/b8dcd1f7ed16cfdeda22728da794a66e95f2870c))
* **core:** Write a main contract file alongside the hashed contract file when in contractDir mode. Useful for spotting changes to the main branch ([afb2e66](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/afb2e66ab415d2447ee983585c39e66d67d4e0eb))


### Bug Fixes

* **core:** Contract hashes no longer include metadata or broker-provided fields. This means that broker downloaded contracts will match the uploaded hash ([60f4f5f](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/60f4f5f9c2fe3cfaecd3c90c4b5adb94f9dd3b65))
* **core:** Improve error message when non-brokered contract verification is published ([0cfbfa0](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/0cfbfa0471cd7ca0a9eec8b3abc28b3c4183527d))
* **core:** State-handler provided variables were accidentally included in the contract hash, now they aren't ([1f3045f](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/1f3045fb7b9bd6074fec6ec8aaefab9f7b638222))

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **core:** Contracts are now hashed to create the filename. This is a breaking change, because the default contractDir now stores contracts in subdirs (by provider name) and allows overwriting the contract file. This improves monorepo support. See the configuration documentation for details.

### Bug Fixes

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* The `mocks` module has been renamed `interactions`; and `AnyMockDescriptor` has been renamed `AnyInteractionDescriptor`. You may need to update your imports
* Replace runExample / runRejectingExample / runThrowingExample with runInteraction / runRejectingInteraction / runThrowingInteraction

* Add ability for matchers to validate their own content. This is a breaking change for any plugin authors, as matcher Executor implementations now need to provide validation functions

### Features

* Add ability for matchers to validate their own content. This is a breaking change for any plugin authors, as matcher Executor implementations now need to provide validation functions ([afaa8d7](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/afaa8d75d81e45ca7609f89b1e17819183bc59b2))

### Bug Fixes

* Add debugging information to the broker 403 error ([a8cbb70](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/a8cbb70703fb19ac0351c038edeb23545b980ec3))
* Allow different tests to have different values for the same default state variable. Contracts using state variables from the previous version will need to be regnerated ([2984d2b](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/2984d2baf29406fab884c5fffc790b6022621047))

* Fix an issue where if the verifier was called with multiple contracts, they would inappropriately run concurrently ([83a8edd](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/83a8eddaf9a87231506cc39fc3439325923dd4bc))
* Improve logging when multiple contracts are verified ([9f3f4a2](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/9f3f4a249eeafdb4da57aef11807ff3e23f544d3))


### Code Refactoring

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* Replace the config object in triggers with a clearer SetupInfo type, allowing cross-language function calls as mocks. Note that the function calls now always return json strings, user-facing DSLs will need to parse the strings

### Bug Fixes

* Improve broker logging and error reporting ([61fb28d](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/61fb28d362879fe68e70b2b15504da5c8b82ec5a))

* Exit with a warning and success if there is no broker baseurl when downloading contracts. In the future, this will be an error again
* Rename all internal fields from "case:*" to "_case:*" for compatibility with JSii. Contract files written before this change will need to be regenerated

## [0.7.0](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/case/compare/v0.6.2...v0.7.0) (2023-04-07)

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

- Rename the verifier options triggers.verifiers to triggers.testResponses and triggers.errorVerifiers to triggers.testErrorResponses for consistency with the runExample DSL
- Rename `contract.verifyContract` to `contract.runVerification` for consistency
- Verification now supports reading contracts from a directory, to allow contract download from a broker. The interface to `verifyContract` has now changed - use contractFilename or contractDirectory instead of passing the raw contract.
- Change the default to not publish contracts if not in CI. Set the new config option `publish: true` or `publish: "ALWAYS"` if you need the old behaviour of always publishing
- All matcher and mock types are now prefixed with `case:`. This change allows extensions without naming clashes, but means any contracts prior to this version must be regenerated.

### Features

- Add ability to publish verification results ([cc2b7c2](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/case/commit/cc2b7c287b4e08607cced24d1f6db1eb2d9cc1b1))
