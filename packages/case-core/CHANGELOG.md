# Changelog

## [0.18.0](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/compare/@contract-case/case-core-v0.17.1...@contract-case/case-core-v0.18.0) (2024-10-17)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* Replace the config object in triggers with a clearer SetupInfo type, allowing cross-language function calls as mocks. Note that the function calls now always return json strings, user-facing DSLs will need to parse the strings

### Bug Fixes

* Improve broker logging and error reporting ([61fb28d](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/61fb28d362879fe68e70b2b15504da5c8b82ec5a))


### Code Refactoring

* Replace the config object in triggers with a clearer SetupInfo type, allowing cross-language function calls as mocks. Note that the function calls now always return json strings, user-facing DSLs will need to parse the strings ([c9ddd93](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/c9ddd93782b5e11cd5925ea76e089e0d779fdc11))

## [0.7.0](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/case/compare/v0.6.2...v0.7.0) (2023-04-07)

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

- Rename the verifier options triggers.verifiers to triggers.testResponses and triggers.errorVerifiers to triggers.testErrorResponses for consistency with the runExample DSL
- Rename `contract.verifyContract` to `contract.runVerification` for consistency
- Verification now supports reading contracts from a directory, to allow contract download from a broker. The interface to `verifyContract` has now changed - use contractFilename or contractDirectory instead of passing the raw contract.
- Change the default to not publish contracts if not in CI. Set the new config option `publish: true` or `publish: "ALWAYS"` if you need the old behaviour of always publishing
- All matcher and mock types are now prefixed with `case:`. This change allows extensions without naming clashes, but means any contracts prior to this version must be regenerated.

### Features

- Add ability to publish verification results ([cc2b7c2](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/case/commit/cc2b7c287b4e08607cced24d1f6db1eb2d9cc1b1))
