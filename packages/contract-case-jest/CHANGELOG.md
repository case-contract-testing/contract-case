### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **core:** New behaviour of using contacts like snapshots - the new setting changedContracts changes the behaviour when contracts are changed. Either 'FAIL' for fail when a contract is changed, or 'OVERWRITE' for overwriting when a contract is changed. Default is to FAIL, so this is a breaking change.

* **core:** Write a main contract file alongside the hashed contract file when in contractDir mode. Useful for spotting changes to the main branch ([afb2e66](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/afb2e66ab415d2447ee983585c39e66d67d4e0eb))


### Bug Fixes

* **core:** State-handler provided variables were accidentally included in the contract hash, now they aren't ([1f3045f](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/1f3045fb7b9bd6074fec6ec8aaefab9f7b638222))

* **jest:** Expose package as CJS so that it plays better with jest ([34e8a3b](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/34e8a3b84b6b77a460dde5a76ae92a8e25acf504))

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **core:** Contracts are now hashed to create the filename. This is a breaking change, because the default contractDir now stores contracts in subdirs (by provider name) and allows overwriting the contract file. This improves monorepo support. See the configuration documentation for details.

## [0.7.0](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/case/compare/v0.6.2...v0.7.0) (2023-04-07)

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

- Rename the verifier options triggers.verifiers to triggers.testResponses and triggers.errorVerifiers to triggers.testErrorResponses for consistency with the runExample DSL
- Rename `contract.verifyContract` to `contract.runVerification` for consistency
- Verification now supports reading contracts from a directory, to allow contract download from a broker. The interface to `verifyContract` has now changed - use contractFilename or contractDirectory instead of passing the raw contract.
- Change the default to not publish contracts if not in CI. Set the new config option `publish: true` or `publish: "ALWAYS"` if you need the old behaviour of always publishing
- All matcher and mock types are now prefixed with `case:`. This change allows extensions without naming clashes, but means any contracts prior to this version must be regenerated.

### Features

- Add ability to publish verification results ([cc2b7c2](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/case/commit/cc2b7c287b4e08607cced24d1f6db1eb2d9cc1b1))

([e0b9fbb](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/case/commit/e0b9fbb441ab393bcfeb9fb987b424b698411514))
- When saving contracts, create contract directory if it doesn't already exist ([72f8edb](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/case/commit/72f8edbb3ebb7f38833109f12878edbfaa2549b6))
