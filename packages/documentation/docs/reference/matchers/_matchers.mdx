In ContractCase, a Test Equivalence Matcher makes the promise "this specific example covers all cases where the request / response / message (etc) passes this matcher"

These matchers aren’t for describing the entire request/response schema, they’re
for making it easier to write tests. Matchers are a convenience - they don't make your test any more correct, they just allow you to add flexibility to a test, so that you don’t have to
have the same exact test data on both sides.

For example, say a test expects the following payload::

```typescript
{
  name: anyString('Steve');
}
```

This test says "there's a name field which must be a string (for example, Steve), and this test covers all cases where any string name is returned".
