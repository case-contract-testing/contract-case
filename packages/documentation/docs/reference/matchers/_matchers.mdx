In ContractCase, a Test Equivalence Matcher makes the promise:

> **this specific example covers all cases where the request / response / message (etc) passes this matcher**

Matchers aren't intended to describe the entire request/response schema, they're
for making it easier to write tests. Matchers are a convenience - they don't
make your test any more correct, they just allow you to add flexibility to a
test, so that you don't have to
have the same exact test data on both sides.

For example, say a test expects the following payload::

```typescript
{
  name: anyString('Steve');
}
```

This test says: 

> there's a name field which must be a string (for example, Steve), and this test covers all cases where any string name is returned
