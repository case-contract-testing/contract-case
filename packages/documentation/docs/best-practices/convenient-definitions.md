# Ways to write contracts easily and conveniently

:::caution DRAFT

While ContractCase is in beta, some of the documentation is incomplete or bullet points only.

Each breaking change during the beta, one more document will be completed. If this notice is present in a document, it is not yet considered complete. If you are having trouble using ContractCase or you would like a particular document prioritised, please [open an issue](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/case/issues/new)
:::

- `namedLookup` for looking up a named segment
- Automatically named request / response pairs
- stateHandlers and Config in the runExample or the main contract call
