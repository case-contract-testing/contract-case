# Contract Files


In ContractCase, a contract is between two specific deployable things (eg, the user
service, and the web frontend). It's written down in a contract file.

## What's in a contract?

The contract file is written by ContractCase during contract definition. It
describes all the interactions that the consumer expects the provider to
implement. 

Each of these interactions are described by example - meaning that they're a
record of specific expectations that the consumer has:

  - Expected Request 
     * For example: an HTTP `GET` for `/users/123`
  - Example Response
    * For example: a `200 OK` response containing a `User` object as JSON

To make it easy to reason about the examples in a contract, each
example runs independently. This avoids complex and potentially brittle
integration tests. To achieve this
independence, any preconditions are handled by
state setup functions. This means each interaction contains:

  - Provider state(s) 
     * For example: "the server has a user named `John Smith` with ID `123`"
  - Expected Request 
     * For example: an HTTP `GET` for `/users/123`
  - Example Response
    * For example: a `200 OK` response containing a `User` object as JSON

The contract file contains at least one - but usually more - of these examples,
plus some metadata about the contract. This metadata includes things like the
consumer that generated it, the producer it is for, etc.

Here's a concrete example of one interaction:

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="js" label="Typescript">
    <StateJs />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
   <StateJava />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Do I need to open the contract file?

No, you shouldn't need to open the contract file. It's expected to be opaque to
the user.

ContractCase should describe everything you need to know about it in the output
of a test run. If you run into problems, you can set the log level to debug to
find out what is happening during your test run, and this should provide
everything you need.

Curious users are welcome to look in the file, of course. It's just JSON. If you do, take care not to modify it, or the expectations of the consumer that you verify won't be accurate.
