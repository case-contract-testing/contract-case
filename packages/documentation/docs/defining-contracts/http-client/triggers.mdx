# Triggers

When writing a contract for an HTTP client, you will need to define a `trigger` function for each interaction.
In it, you should call your real client code
here, and return the business object that your client returns. 

### Interactions where the client code succeeds

If your interaction models a success (ie, it doesn't throw any exceptions or reject any promises) then:

1. ContractCase calls your `trigger` function to invoke the client code for that interaction.
2. If there was no exception, it passes the object returned from the trigger to your `testResponse` function
3. If there was an exception from the `trigger`, the test is marked as failed,
and the contract definition will not be successful.

### Interactions where the client code is expected to fail

If your interaction models a failure (ie, it doesn't return an object, and
instead throws an exception / rejects a promise / completes a future
exceptionally), then: 

1. ContractCase calls your `trigger` function to invoke the client code for that interaction.
2. If there was no exception, the test is marked as failed,
and the contract definition will not be successful.
3. If there was an exception from the `trigger`, that exception is passed to your `testErrorResponse` function


## Writing a trigger

Triggers are functions with one `InteractionSetup` argument. The interaction setup
object contains the details of the mock that ContractCase has set up, 
and the resolved values for any state variables. 

In an HTTP client test, this will include the base URL for the mock server:
