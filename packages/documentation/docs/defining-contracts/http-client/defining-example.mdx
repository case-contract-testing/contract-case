# Defining an interaction

In ContractCase, a contract is a series of examples of interactions. 
In English, an interaction might be "a getUser request looks like $X, and a success response looks like $Y":

Instead of making examples dependent on each other (and the corresponding
explosion of complexity and potentially brittle tests), each **interaction
runs independently** during contract definition. 

This is achieved with [state definitions](./state-definitions), 
which you can define any preconditions that your interaction needs (for example "a user with ID 'foo' must exist").


A complete interaction looks like:

* States: 
   * When the server has a user named `` with ID `123`
* a getUser request looks like $X, and
* the success response looks like $Y

For example:

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="js" label="Typescript">
    <StateJs />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
   <StateJava />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


:::tip How are these states handled later?

After your contract is written, the provider verification will use [state
handlers](../../verifying-contracts/http-server/state-handlers) to fill in the implementation details.

## Overriding configuration

You can override the configuration for individual tests by providing an
optional `ContractCaseConfig` object as the final argument. See [the
configuration options reference](/docs/reference/configuring) for full details.
For example, here's how you could set the log level to debug for an individual
test:

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="js" label="Typescript">
    <ConfigJs />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
   <ConfigJava />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Setting the log level to debug is a useful way to see what is happening during
the test, which can help you understand why an example might be failing.

## Do I describe the whole API payload?

You only need to describe the parts of the API payload that your consumer relies on.

This is advantageous because it's not a breaking change to rename or remove a field/endpoint that
no-one is using. 

### Next steps

Next, set up your state [state definitions](./state-definitions).
