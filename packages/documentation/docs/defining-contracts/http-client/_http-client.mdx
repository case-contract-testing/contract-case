By far the most common contract definition is an http client contract. Most http
contracts are json contracts. 

For each interaction in an http client contract, you describe:

* *The server state*: This is usually a human readable string, eg "a user exists with ID=123".
* *The http request*: This is the request your client will send.
* *The http response*: This is what you expect the server to respond with in the
  given server state. Note that this is a minimal response - if your consumer
  doesn't need a particular field, you don't need to include it in the contract.
