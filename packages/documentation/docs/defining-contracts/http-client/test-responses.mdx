# Testing responses

Once you've written your [triggers](./triggers), you'll need to write either a
`testResponse` or a `testErrorResponse` function.

These are used to confirm that your client understood the response from the server. 
These functions are separate from the trigger so that ContractCase can tell the
difference between a problem in your client code and a problem in the
verification of the object returned from your client code. 

## Test Response Function

Use this if your client code is expected to succeed during this interaction.

In a test response function, you should assert that your client code has successfully understood
the response and marshalled it into whatever business object the rest of your code expects.

## Test Error Response Function

Use this if your client code is expected to complete with an exception / rejected promise during an interaction.

In a test error response function, you should assert that your client code has correctly understood
the response and marshalled it into whatever failed exception / error object the rest of your code expects.

```ts
testErrorResponse: (error: Error, config: MockConfig): Promise<unknown> | void
```

This is equivalent to the `testResponse` function, but for `trigger` calls that are expected to fail with an error.

### With `runExample`

If we define this example at the client side, we will also need a trigger, and a way to test the response object:

```ts
await contract.runExample({
    states: [
        inState('Server is up'),
        inState('A user with id "foo" exists'),
    ],
    definition: willSendHttpRequest({
        request: {
            method: 'GET',
            path: '/users/foo',
        },
        response: {
            status: 200,
            body: {
                userId: 'foo'
                name: 'john smith',
            },
        },
    }),
  },
  {
    // The trigger is the invocation of your client code
    // It receives some configuration with details of how to contact the mock
    // This function should return the business object that your API returns
    trigger: (config: HttpRequestConfig) =>
        new YourApi(config.baseUrl).getUser('foo'),
    // The testResponse function is used to check the business object.
    // This is an important step, as without it, ContractCase can't be sure that your
    // calling code can understand the objects that your code is generating.
    //
    // It receives the object that was returned by your trigger
    // If your trigger throws an error, the test will fail
    testResponse: (user) => {
        expect(user).toEqual({ userId: 'foo', name: 'john smith' });
    }
})
```

### With `runRejectingExample`

If your API is expected to throw an error during the invocation, then you should use `runRejectingExample` instead of `runExample`, and use `testErrorResponse` instead of `testResponse`:

```ts
await contract.runRejectingExample(
  {
    states: [inState('Server is up'), inState('No users exist')],
    definition: willSendHttpRequest({
      request: {
        method: 'GET',
        path: '/users/foo',
      },
      response: {
        status: 404,
      },
    }),
  },
  {
    // The trigger is the invocation of your client code
    // It receives some configuration with details of how to contact the mock
    // This function should return the business object that your API returns
    trigger: (config: HttpRequestConfig) =>
      new YourApi(config.baseUrl).getUser('foo'),
    // The testErrorResponse function is used to check the business object.
    // This is an important step, as without it, ContractCase can't be sure that your
    // calling code can understand the objects that your code is generating.
    //
    // It receives the object that was thrown by your trigger.
    // If your trigger does not throw an error, the test will fail
    testErrorResponse: (e) => {
      expect(e).toBeInstanceOf(UserNotFoundError);
    },
  },
);
```

Triggers and `testResponse`/`testErrorResponse` functions are not written to the contract.
