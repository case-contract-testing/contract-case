# Creating a contract

Every contract begins with a `defineContract` call, which names the
consumer and provider pairs that this contract is for. Additional configuration
can be provided at this point, see [the configuration options reference](/docs/reference/configuring) for details.

For example, defining a contract might look like:

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="js" label="Typescript">
    <CreatingJs />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
   <CreatingJava />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In some languages, you may also need to end the contract once all of your tests
have completed. This tells ContractCase to write the contract file to disk.

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="js" label="Typescript">
    ```
    // With Typescript/Javascript, there is no need 
    // to explicitly end the contract as the
    // `defineContract` Jest DSL handles this for you
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
   <WritingJava />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## How to name your consumers and providers

The names of your consumer and provider should be the human readable name of
your consumer / provider deployable - for example, "ExampleCo desktop app" or
"User Profile Service".

The names should be _unique_ within your deployment ecosystem -
if you end up with two implementations of the same service that might deploy at
different times, they should have
different names. For example, if you have an existing deployable called
"Foo CLI", and some of your engineers decide they should rewrite it in Rust,
their consumer / provider name can't also be "Foo CLI" - ideally, it should be something
that the people on your teams will understand - it could be something like "Foo CLI (Rust)"

:::tip Note
There's no reason you can't have a consumer be its own provider - this is common
in the case of queues that a service both reads and writes to. At verification
time, you would always verify the current version of the contract, and also any
previous versions that might reasonably still have messages in the queue
:::

## Choosing which side is the consumer

In consumer-driven contract testing, we define the contract on the consumer
side, and verify it at the provider side.

Unlike other contract testing systems, the client in ContractCase isn't always
the consumer. However, although it's _possible_ for the server to be the consumer,
this is a rare use case.
If it's your first time with contract testing, we strongly
recommend you choose the client to be the consumer.

If you're unsure, each specific contract definition section starts with some guidance on the
use cases that it's appropriate for.

## Contracts don't have to be all one type of communication

Although each guide is written assuming that all interactions in your contract
are of the same type, there's no reason you can't mix them up in the same
contract. For example, a consumer might consume messages and http responses from
the same provider. ContractCase supports this - just mix definitions within the same .

## Circular contract dependencies

Sometimes, service A is a consumer of service B, but service B also consumes service A.
For example, Service A might be a client of some http endpoints on service B;
while Service B might be a client of different http endpoints on Service A.

```
Service A -> Service B
Service A <- Service B
```

This is completely supported by ContractCase. Just:

- Define a contract at Service A for Service B
- Set up contract verification on Service B
- Define a contract at Service B for service A.
- Set up contract verification on Service A

You may complete these steps in any practical order - a circular dependency
introduces no additional challenges for contract testing.
