 * @param setup - The configuration of your interaction
 *              (ie, state variables, properties of the running mock, etc.)
 * @typeParam R - the return type of your client code (ie, your business object)
 * @typeParam C - the type of the Config for this mock (eg `HttpRequestConfig`)
 * @returns a Promise that either resolves to a value of type `R`, or rejects
 *          with an error if the client code failed or threw an error
