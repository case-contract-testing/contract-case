# Triggers object

Unlike 

In both contract definition and contract verification, you can provide a `TriggerGroupMap` object to your `CaseConfig`, under the key `triggers`.

Each `TriggerGroup` is an object keyed by request name, where each value is of type:

```ts
{
  trigger: TriggerFunction;
  testResponses: Record<string, TestResponseFunction>;
  testErrorResponses: Record<string, TestErrorResponseFunction>;
}
```

If you provide this `triggers` object, ContractCase will first find the request trigger,
then find the matching `testResponse` or `testErrorResponse` function associated
with that trigger. The test functions are associated with the trigger because
sometimes the same response needs to be tested differently when it is received by
different triggers.

```ts
{
  triggers: new TriggerGroupMap()
    .addTriggerGroup('an http "GET" request to "/health" without a body', {
      trigger: (config: HttpRequestConfig) => api(config.baseUrl).health(),
      testResponses: {
        'a (200) response with body an object shaped like {status: "up"}': (
          health,
        ) => {
          expect(health).toEqual('up');
        },
        'a (200) response with body an object shaped like {status: <any string>}':
          (health) => expect(typeof health).toBe('string'),
      },
      testErrorResponses: {
        'a (httpStatus 4XX | 5XX) response without a body': (e) => {
          expect(e).toBeInstanceOf(ApiError);
        },
        'a (503) response with body an object shaped like {status: "down"}': (
          e,
        ) => {
          expect(e).toBeInstanceOf(ApiError);
        },
      },
    })
    .addTriggerGroup(
      'an http "GET" request to "/health" with the following headers {accept: "application/json"} without a body',
      {
        trigger: (config: HttpRequestConfig) => api(config.baseUrl).health(),
        testResponses: {
          'a (200) response with body an object shaped like {status: "up"}': (
            health,
          ) => {
            expect(health).toEqual('up');
          },
        },
      },
    );
}
```
