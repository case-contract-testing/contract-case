# Writing state handlers

If the service under test is an HTTP server, you will need to provide state handlers.

State handlers are defined with the `stateHandlers` key on the
`ContractCaseConfig` object. The `stateHandlers` object is keyed by the state
name.

## When are state handlers invoked?

State handlers are invoked by ContractCase during setup for Examples that were defined
with states (see the [ContractCase Example Lifecycle](/docs/reference/lifecycle)).

The order of execution of state setup handlers is the same as the order that the states
were defined in. During teardown, the state teardown handlers execute in the reverse order.

## What should a state handler do?

State handlers are invoked to set some preconditions for your service. This
means that each Example is able to be independent, allowing your tests to be
specific and easily repeatable.

A state handler is a function that is able to modify the state of a
running service. This is usually done by mocking the repository layer of your
service, but it can also be done by inserting into a database, or mocking at the
equivalent of the controller layer of your service.

We recommend mocking the repository layer in your service code. This is so that
your mock is simple and expressed in domain concepts: when `"user '10' exists"`
then `repo.getUser('10')` returns `<A concrete user object>`. This is more
comfortable to read and maintain than SQL insert statements, and provides a
cleaner boundary for your own consumer contract tests.

Optionally, a state handler can provide a teardown function too. This is
provided in case you need to undo the precondition setup (removing records from
the database, changing the mock back to a default, etc).

## Implementing your state handler

During verification of the contract above, a state handler would need to be written:

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="js" label="Typescript">
    <HandlerJs />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
   <HandlerJava />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Setup state handlers

A setup state handler is is only invoked during the state setup lifecycle phase.

It can be defined as simple function:

```ts
stateHandlers: {
    'Server is up': () => {
       // Configure your running server to appear to be up here
    },
},
```

Or as a `setup` key if you have both a setup and a teardown handler:

```ts
stateHandlers: {
    'Server is up': {
        setup: () => {
            // Configure your running server to appear to be up here
        },
    }
},
```

If your function needs to be asynchronous, you can return a `Promise` or make it `async`.

```ts
stateHandlers: {
    'Server is up': {
        setup: async () => {
            // Configure your running server to appear to be up here
        },
    }
},
```

### Returning variables from state setup

If the state has variables, your state setup function must return an object keyed by variable name,
where each value is the variable value. You must provide a value for all
variables, and those values must match any Test Equivalence Matchers set on the
variable when it was set up.

```ts
stateHandlers: {
    // assuming inState('A user exists', { userId: 'foo' })
    'A user exists': async () => {
        const userId: string = await insertUser({ .... });
        return { userId };
    },

    // .... etc
},
```

### State teardown functions

State teardown functions are run after the interaction has completed execution (see
the [interaction lifecycle documentation](/docs/reference/lifecycle) for
more information).

State teardown functions are specified with the `teardown` key on a state setup object:

```ts
stateHandlers: {
    'A user exists': {
        setup:  async () => {
            const userId: string = await insertUser({ .... });
            return { userId };
        },
        teardown: async () => {
            await removeUsers();
        }
    }
},
```

State teardown functions do not need to return anything.
