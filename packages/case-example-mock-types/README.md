[![Build and test](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/case/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/case/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml)
[![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/github/case-contract-testing/case/badge.svg?targetFile=packages/case-example-mock-types/package.json)](https://snyk.io/test/github/case-contract-testing/case?targetFile=packages/case-example-mock-types/package.json)

These are the [CaseExample mock types](https://case.contract-testing.io/docs/reference/example-types) for the ContractCase contract testing suite. Read [the documentation here](https://case.contracttesting.io)

This module is separate because it is part of the boundary translated with JSii.
