## ConfigurationErrorCodes.CASE\_CRASH\_ADVICE property

This error code is never emitted, it exists to allow the advice given in the crash reporter to be overridden.

Hopefully, you didn't know the crash reporter exists - when ContractCase crashes, it prints the stack trace and asks the user to report the crash as a bug. This code can be used to replace the bug report request part of the crash report.

**Signature:**

```typescript
CASE_CRASH_ADVICE: 'CASE_CRASH_ADVICE';
```
