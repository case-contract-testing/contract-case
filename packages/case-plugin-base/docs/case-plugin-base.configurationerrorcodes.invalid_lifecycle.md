## ConfigurationErrorCodes.INVALID\_LIFECYCLE property

A lifecycle method was called out of order.

Check that your code has the method calls in the right order.

Although care has been taken to prevent invalid lifecycle calls from being possible, there are still some cases where this can happen.

For contract definition, it should be:

1. Begin definition (optionally load plugins, and register functions)

2. Multiple calls to runInteraction or your language's equivalent of runRejectingInteraction

3. End record (writing the contract).

Check that you're not accidentally reusing test instances between runs.

For contract verification, it should be:

1. Construct verifier (optionally load plugins, and register functions)

2. Call prepareVerification to get a list of test handles

3. Call each of those test handles to execute the interaction

4. Call closePreparedVerification (or close(), depending on your DSL)
