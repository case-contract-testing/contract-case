## ConfigurationErrorCodes.INVALID\_LIFECYCLE property

A lifecycle method was called out of order.

Check that your code has the method calls in the right order.

Although care has been taken to prevent invalid lifecycle calls from being possible, there are still some cases where this can happen.

For contract definition, it should be:

1. Begin definition 2. Multiple calls to runInteraction or your language's equivalent of runRejectingInteraction 3. End record (writing the contract).

Check that you're not accidentally reusing test instances between runs.

**Signature:**

```typescript
INVALID_LIFECYCLE: 'INVALID_LIFECYCLE';
```
