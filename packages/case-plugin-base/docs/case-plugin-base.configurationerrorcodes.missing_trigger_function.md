## ConfigurationErrorCodes.MISSING\_TRIGGER\_FUNCTION property

The current interaction needs a trigger defined, but there wasn't one configured.

Trigger functions are what ContractCase uses to kick off an interaction. They're used to trigger the code under test.

This error is most likely to be experienced:

- If you've forgotten the `trigger` part of a `runInteraction` - If you're verifying a contract that needs triggers provided (for example, an HTTP server contract).

In the latter case, triggers need to be keyed exactly by the name of the request - for example, "A request to get user".

Check that your CaseConfig has the appropriate triggers set.

**Signature:**

```typescript
MISSING_TRIGGER_FUNCTION: 'MISSING_TRIGGER_FUNCTION';
```
