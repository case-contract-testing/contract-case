## ConfigurationErrorCodes.MISSING\_REGISTERED\_FUNCTION property

The current interaction needs a user-provided function registered with ContractCase.

When the contract expects a function that can be called by ContractCase, you must first register it with `registerFunction` so that it can be called during the interaction.

If you experience this when verifying a new version of an existing contract, it may be because the contract has changed to expect a call to a function name that wasn't previously in the contract.

Check that you have registered all the functions that the contract expects.

**Signature:**

```typescript
MISSING_REGISTERED_FUNCTION: 'MISSING_REGISTERED_FUNCTION';
```
