## mustResolveToNumber() function

During a matcher execution, this function can be called to ensure that the provided matcher resolves to number.

**Signature:**

```typescript
mustResolveToNumber: (matcher: AnyCaseMatcherOrData, context: MatchContext) => number
```

## Parameters

</td><td>

the current [MatchContext](./case-plugin-base.matchcontext.md)


</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
**Returns:**

number

the number value that the matcher resolves to

## Exceptions

a [CaseConfigurationError](./case-plugin-base.caseconfigurationerror.md) if the matcher doesn't resolve to a number.

## Remarks

Use it if you expect that it's not possible for the matcher to resolve to anything other than a number, as it throws a [CaseConfigurationError](./case-plugin-base.caseconfigurationerror.md)<!-- -->.

If you use this function during a `check` operation, then the `CaseConfigurationError` will ultimately become a `CaseCoreError`<!-- -->, because it's not supposed to be possible to throw exceptions from a `check`

If you're using it in `check`<!-- -->, make sure you also call it in `validate`<!-- -->.
