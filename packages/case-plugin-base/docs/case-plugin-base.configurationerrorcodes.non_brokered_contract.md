## ConfigurationErrorCodes.NON\_BROKERED\_CONTRACT property

Tried to publish verification results for a contract that doesn't have information on where to publish the verification results.

This can happen if you're sharing contracts locally, but still have publishing verification results enabled.

**Signature:**

```typescript
NON_BROKERED_CONTRACT: 'NON_BROKERED_CONTRACT';
```
