## TypeContainer type

Indicates a container type.

Currently only supports arrays, but in the future may allow specific matchers.

Implementations should switch on `kind` and fail if they get a kind that they don't recognise.

If you have a use-case that needs more complex container types, please raise an issue.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type TypeContainer = {
    readonly kind: 'array';
    readonly type: ParameterType;
};
```
