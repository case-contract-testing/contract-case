## ConfigurationErrorCodes.FAKE\_NEVER\_CALLED property

The fake function set up by contract case was never called.

This usually means there's an error in the trigger code under test. It means there was an expectation set up the trigger code would call a function (eg an endpoint, or a function call), but no such call ever arrived.

Depending on the interaction type, this may mean that you are calling the wrong endpoint, a different service, or simply not making any calls.

Check that your code under test is correctly calling the fake service set up by this interaction.

**Signature:**

```typescript
FAKE_NEVER_CALLED: 'FAKE_NEVER_CALLED';
```
