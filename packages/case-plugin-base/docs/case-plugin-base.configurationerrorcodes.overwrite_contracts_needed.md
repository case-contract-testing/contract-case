## ConfigurationErrorCodes.OVERWRITE\_CONTRACTS\_NEEDED property

The existing contract didn't match the new contract being written.

This is an error when ContractCase is running in validate snapshot mode, where defined contracts are checked against the contract on disk, and a failure happens if the new contract is different.

To address this, you'll need to run contract definitions with a changedContracts behaviour set to overwrite the contract instead of check.

Please re-run your tests with one of:

\* The configuration property changedContracts is set to 'OVERWRITE' \* The environment variable CASE\_changedContracts=OVERWRITE

If you see this on consecutive runs, please check that your contract doesn't contain randomness during contract definition

**Signature:**

```typescript
OVERWRITE_CONTRACTS_NEEDED: 'OVERWRITE_CONTRACTS_NEEDED';
```
