## addLocation() function

Adds the current location to the context. Used to determine where we are when printing logs and errors.

There are some semantics here:

Locations are joined together with `.`<!-- -->. For example, calling:

```
    addLocation('b', addLocation('a', context))
```
will result in `"a.b"` being the location at print time.

If the location is part of an iteration, put it in square brackets, for example `[2]` or `[keyName]`<!-- -->. This will prevent the location logger from adding `.` between consecutive locations. For example:

```
    addLocation('[1]', addLocation('a', context))
```
will result in `"a[1]"` being the location at print time.

If the location starts with `:`<!-- -->, it's only logged during maintainer logs. For example:

```
    addLocation(':internalDetail', addLocation('a', context))
```
will result in `"a"` during normal and debug logging, but `a:internalDetail` when maintainer logging (or deeper) is enabled

**Signature:**

```typescript
addLocation: (location: string, context: MatchContext) => MatchContext
```
