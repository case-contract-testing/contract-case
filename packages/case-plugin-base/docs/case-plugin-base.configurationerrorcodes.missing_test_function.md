## ConfigurationErrorCodes.MISSING\_TEST\_FUNCTION property

The current interaction needs a response test defined, but there wasn't one configured.

After the code under test has been called, the response from it must be tested. You provide a test-response or test-error-response function to check that the code under test has correctly understood the response.

This error is most likely to be experienced:

- If you've provided a `testResponse` but you need to provide a `testErrorResponse` (or vice versa). - If you're verifying a contract that needs triggers provided (for example, an HTTP server contract), and you don't have the test response implemented.

In the latter case, response tests need to be keyed exactly by the name of the response - for example, "throwing a UserNotFound Exception" or "returns null".

Check that your CaseConfig has the appropriate response test functions set.

**Signature:**

```typescript
MISSING_TEST_FUNCTION: 'MISSING_TEST_FUNCTION';
```
