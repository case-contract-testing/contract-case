## ConfigurationErrorCodes.MISSING\_STATE\_HANDLER property

The current interaction was configured to have a particular state setup handler, but it was missing.

State handlers are functions that you define to set up a particular state within your code (for example, an interaction on an HTTP provider might have a state named `'User with id 123 exists'`<!-- -->).

This error indicates that Contractcase was expecting a named state handler, but it couldn't find it.

This usually indicates a misconfiguration - check that you have provided a state handler with the exact name of the handler that was missing in the configuration of your test.

If you need help investigating this error, you can set the configuration property `logLevel` to `'DEBUG'` to see a list of the configured state handlers.

**Signature:**

```typescript
MISSING_STATE_HANDLER: 'MISSING_STATE_HANDLER';
```
