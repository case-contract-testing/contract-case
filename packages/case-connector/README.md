This is the server connector (formerly case-boundary) to allow ContractCase to be run as a server.

If you're wanting to learn about ContractCase, [start here instead](https://case.contract-testing.io/docs/intro)

Don't depend on this directly unless you are writing a custom wrapper for ContractCase.

This package exists to work around [this JSii](https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/4133)
bug, by exposing the communication layer as a gRPC service.

Additionally, it exposes the boundary layer as `@contract-case/case-connector` for ESM imports, and `@contract-case/case-connector/cjs` for CJS imports.

For details of the protocol schema, see the case-connector-proto package.
