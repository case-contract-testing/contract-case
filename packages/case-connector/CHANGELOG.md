# Changelog

## [0.20.1](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/compare/@contract-case/case-connector-v0.20.0...@contract-case/case-connector-v0.20.1) (2025-03-22)


### Bug Fixes

* **case-connector:** Add the service to the server before starting, reducing chance of UNAVAILABLE errors ([39f3194](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/39f3194b86b1dd8632d29f3d9bc25d8a75655566))


### Dependencies

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **core:** Contracts are now hashed to create the filename. This is a breaking change, because the default contractDir now stores contracts in subdirs (by provider name) and allows overwriting the contract file. This improves monorepo support. See the configuration documentation for details.
