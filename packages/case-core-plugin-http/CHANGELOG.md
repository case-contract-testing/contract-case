### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* **core:** Removed the assumption that every interaction response can be described by "returns". This is a breaking change, because it needs contracts to be re-written, and http contracts with automatically named triggers will have to change triggers from \`"a (200) ..."\` to \`"returns a (200) ..."\`. If you need to stay compatible with contracts from before this version, you will need to provide both names in your trigger definitions

* Allow specifying baseUrlUnderTest via mockConfig ([052ea3f](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/052ea3f6fadb95c7140c75024ac181b2fd8743ad))


### Bug Fixes

* Correct issue where correctly configured http plugins said they weren't correctly configured ([df386cb](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/df386cb2e8ca41d6c1a06819dc84c611bb1b74ea))
* Fix issue where tests could hang on node 18 ([e023711](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/e023711337a015eee3297fe42cc251c0ff49ef05))
* Improve plugin configuration error messages ([11d44bb](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/11d44bb8e951df8197ce3a7abaf9ca1d3e2a817d))


### Miscellaneous Chores

* Split HTTP mock and matchers to their own packages ([bfc2e4f](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/bfc2e4ff2d464899fd8ce63978048e9f1991ff80))


### Code Refactoring

* Export plugin as the default export instead of named ([78397d2](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/78397d2bea51b41f1c6b53bc70fdc741f5e7d084))
